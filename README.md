Code Repository for the IR course570
This repo contains an implementation of mini search engine using the Whoosh library in python. We have implemented three weighting
measures namely TF, TF-IDF and BM25. Also we have written code for all the four combination for indexes in stemming/stopwords. 
Also performance comparison is also done using precision, MAP and NDCG as the tools. Also some additional features such as query 
suggestion have been included. All the types of queries such as NOT, OR, AND and phrasal are supported.
